It's the process of painstakingly going through a written document to find and correct errors, particularly citation errors. *See, e.g.* [this link](http://www.aulawreview.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=39&Itemid=46).

But, right now, it's very much a WIP. Feel free to contribute.
